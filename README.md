#### Pridicting Heart Disease by using Neural Networks.

**About Dataset**

The dataset contains the following features:

- age(in years)
- sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)
- cp: chest pain type
- trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
- chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
- target: 1 or 0


Expected Outcome from the project

1. Statistical analysis of the data 
2. Create Training and Testing Datasets
3. Building and Training the Neural Network
4. Improving Results - A Binary Classification Problem
5. Results and Metrics
